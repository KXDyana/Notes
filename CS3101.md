# CS3101 Database

## data based applications used to be built directly on top of file systems.
* supported by OS
* separated with delimiters
### potential problems
* data redundancy and inconsistency
    * duplication of information in different files
* difficult to access data: new programs need to be designed for new tasks
* data isolation: multiple different fies and formats
* Integrity problems
    * Integrity Constraints (e.g. account balance > 0) become buried and hidden in program code rather than being stated explicited
    * hard to add new constraints or change existing ones
* Atomicity of updates
    * failures may leave data in an inconsistent state with partial updates carried out: transfer of funds should either be complete or not happen at all
* concurrent access by multiple users
    * needed for performance, but controlled poorly can lead to inconsistencies
* security problems
    * hard to provide user access to some but not all data

## Database Systems
### provide well-controlled data repository
* collection of interrelated data
    * a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning
    * a representation of some of aspect of the real world
    * valuable
    * large
* programs to access data
    * manipulate, maintain, present
* convenient and efficient to use
* concurrent access by multiple users and applications

## Data models
* data
* relationships
* semantics
* constraints

## types of data models
* conceptual/logical model: higher level of abstraction
* physicl model: data at lowest level (implementation), more difficult to understand

* data abstraction: hide complexity of data structures from users
    * physical level: descripbes how a record is stored
    * logical level: describes data and relationships between data is stored
    * view level: provides selected aspects of data. can have a number of views over same data.

## Schemas and instances
* similar to classes and instances in programming languages.
* physical schema: the overall physical structure of the database
* logical schema: the overall logical structure of the database
    * e.g. the databse consists of information about a set of customers and accounts in a bank and the relationship between them.
* instance: the actual content of the databse at a point of time

## physical data independence
* ability of change the physical chema (how the data is stored) without affecting the logical schema
    * internal schema change to improve performance
    * application programs depend on logical schema
    * interfaces between different levels and components are well defined so that changes in some parts do not seriously influence others
    * e.g.: replace the age attribute of an user by calculating the data of birth in real time
## logical data independence
* ability to change the logical schema without having to modify the application programs which make use of them.
    * alteration in the logical schema include addition or deletion of fresh entities, attributes or relationships
    * more difficult to achieve than physical data independence

## database design
* logical design: deciding on the database schema
    * business decision: which attiributes should be recorded in the db
    * computer science decision: what relation schemas should we have and how should the attributes be distributed among the various relationship schemas
* physical design: deciding on the physical layout of the db

### methodologies
* produce specification of requirements
* choose data modelling style
* design data model
* choose databse
* derive schema from data model
* populate database
* queries, updates, mainenance

## database languages
* data definition language (DDL) (structure)
    * notation for degining the databse schema
    * DDL compiler generates a set of table templates stored in a data difcionary
    * data dictionary contains metadata
    * commands like CREATE, DROP, ALTER...
* data manipulation language (DML) (data)
    * language for accessing and manipulating data
    * two types: procedural and declarative
    * commands like SELECT, INSERT, DELETE
* often bothg are aspects of the same databse language such as SQL
## databse engine
* a system is partitioned into modules that deal with each of the responsibilities of the overall system
* the functional components of a database system can be divided into:
    * the storage manager for
        * interaction with OS file manager
        * efficient storing, retriving and updating
    * the query processor component for
        * interpreting and storing data definitions in data dictionary
        * optimising queries
        * executing queries
    * the transaction management component for
        * ensuring the database remains in a correct and consistent state despite system and transaction failures
        * controlling the interaction among concurrent transaction to ensure consistency of the database

## Entity Relationship
### Design Process:
* meet the aims of the enterprice: specification of user requirements (interact with domain experts)
* Three main phases:
    1. conceptual design phase (typiercally ER diagram)
    2. logical design (map ER to Relational Model/OO/...)
    3. Physical design (file organisation, indexing...)

### ER Model
* a database can be modeled as 
    * a collection of entities
    * together with relationships among entities
(an entity is an object that exists and is distinguishable from other objects)
* an entity have descriptive properties (attributes)
* a set of entities share the same set of attribtes.

### attributes
* simple attributes: a single component part (e.g. salary,age)
* composite attribute: attributes coprise multiple component parts (e.g. address: post code, street, city, country)
* single-valued attributes: only one value per entity (e.g. birthday)
* multi-valued attributes: more than one value per entity (e.g. phone number for work, home, mobile......)
* devrived attributes: computed from other attributes

### relationships
* an association that exists between entites
* relationship set: a set of relationships between one of more entity sets
* relationship can also have attributes (e.g. starting date)
### degree of relationships
* binary relationships: involve two entity sets
* n-ary relationships
    * e.g. student work on projects under the guidance of an instructor 
### Multiplicity contraints
* number of times an entity can or must take part in a particular type of relationship
#### participation
* the minimum number of times an entity must take part in a relationship set (e.g.: a student must have an advisor)
#### cardinality
* the maximum number of times an entity must take part in a relationships set (e.g.: a student must have no more than 160 credits)
---
* for a binary relationship set the mapping cardinality must be one of :
    * one to one
    * one to many
    * many to one
    * many to many

### Keys
* candinate key of an entity set is a minimal set of attributes that uniquely identified each entity
    * e.g. module code/title
* primary key; candidate key that is chosen to uniquely identify each entity
    * we choose code as the primary key for module

### Weak Entity Sets
* an eneity set with no candidate keys is referred to as a weak entity set 
* depends on the existence of an identifying entity sets. the weak entity set must have total participation in relationship with identifying eneity set, and the relationship from identifying set to weak entity set must be one to many (e.g. sections of modules)
* discrimnator (partial key) of a weak entity set is the set of attributes that distinguishes among all the entities in the set (e.g. section name, semester, year)
* primary key is formed by the primary keys of the identifying entity sets plus the weak entity set's discriminator (belonging module code)

### ER Diagram: example
* entity sets: rectangle
* attributes: listed inside rectangle
* primary key: underline
* relationship sets : diamond
* relationship attribute: dashed line, box
* composite: indentation
* derived: parenthesis
* multi-valued: braces
* roles (e.g. prerequisite)
* participation: double line (mandatory participation/total participation)
* cardinality: directed line/arrow: one; undirected line: many
* weak eneity sets
    * discriminator: dashed-underline
    * relationships to identifying entity sets: double outline
