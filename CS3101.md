# CS3101 Database

## data based applications used to be built directly on top of file systems.
* supported by OS
* separated with delimiters
### potential problems
* data redundancy and inconsistency
    * duplication of information in different files
* difficult to access data: new programs need to be designed for new tasks
* data isolation: multiple different fies and formats
* Integrity problems
    * Integrity Constraints (e.g. account balance > 0) become buried and hidden in program code rather than being stated explicited
    * hard to add new constraints or change existing ones
* Atomicity of updates
    * failures may leave data in an inconsistent state with partial updates carried out: transfer of funds should either be complete or not happen at all
* concurrent access by multiple users
    * needed for performance, but controlled poorly can lead to inconsistencies
* security problems
    * hard to provide user access to some but not all data

## Database Systems
### provide well-controlled data repository
* collection of interrelated data
    * a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning
    * a representation of some of aspect of the real world
    * valuable
    * large
* programs to access data
    * manipulate, maintain, present
* convenient and efficient to use
* concurrent access by multiple users and applications

## Data models
* data
* relationships
* semantics
* constraints

## types of data models
* conceptual/logical model: higher level of abstraction
* physicl model: data at lowest level (implementation), more difficult to understand

* data abstraction: hide complexity of data structures from users
    * physical level: descripbes how a record is stored
    * logical level: describes data and relationships between data is stored
    * view level: provides selected aspects of data. can have a number of views over same data.

## Schemas and instances
* similar to classes and instances in programming languages.
* physical schema: the overall physical structure of the database
* logical schema: the overall logical structure of the database
    * e.g. the databse consists of information about a set of customers and accounts in a bank and the relationship between them.
* instance: the actual content of the databse at a point of time

## physical data independence
* ability of change the physical chema (how the data is stored) without affecting the logical schema
    * internal schema change to improve performance
    * application programs depend on logical schema
    * interfaces between different levels and components are well defined so that changes in some parts do not seriously influence others
    * e.g.: replace the age attribute of an user by calculating the data of birth in real time
## logical data independence
* ability to change the logical schema without having to modify the application programs which make use of them.
    * alteration in the logical schema include addition or deletion of fresh entities, attributes or relationships
    * more difficult to achieve than physical data independence

## database design
* logical design: deciding on the database schema
    * business decision: which attiributes should be recorded in the db
    * computer science decision: what relation schemas should we have and how should the attributes be distributed among the various relationship schemas
* physical design: deciding on the physical layout of the db

### methodologies
* produce specification of requirements
* choose data modelling style
* design data model
* choose databse
* derive schema from data model
* populate database
* queries, updates, mainenance

## database languages
* data definition language (DDL) (structure)
    * notation for degining the databse schema
    * DDL compiler generates a set of table templates stored in a data difcionary
    * data dictionary contains metadata
    * commands like CREATE, DROP, ALTER...
* data manipulation language (DML) (data)
    * language for accessing and manipulating data
    * two types: procedural and declarative
    * commands like SELECT, INSERT, DELETE
* often bothg are aspects of the same databse language such as SQL
## databse engine
* a system is partitioned into modules that deal with each of the responsibilities of the overall system
* the functional components of a database system can be divided into:
    * the storage manager for
        * interaction with OS file manager
        * efficient storing, retriving and updating
    * the query processor component for
        * interpreting and storing data definitions in data dictionary
        * optimising queries
        * executing queries
    * the transaction management component for
        * ensuring the database remains in a correct and consistent state despite system and transaction failures
        * controlling the interaction among concurrent transaction to ensure consistency of the database
