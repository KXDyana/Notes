Linux: everything is a file

##Types:

* Single-level: everyting has to be uniqie
* Two-level: each user has their own directory. Very secure.
* Tree-structred Directory: more like a modern directory, with root...etc. has a concept of a current directory. No concept of different users directory.
* acyclic directoy (more complicated tree directory) : no cycles, introduces shared files and folders.
