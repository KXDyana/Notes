# CS5020 Communication Principals

## devices
- host = end systems/edge

## Packet Switches
- forward packets (chunks of data)
- routers, switches

## Communication Links
- fiber, copper, radio, satellite
- the rate of transmission: bandwidth

## Networks
- collection of devices, routers...
- internet is a network of networks
- ISP: internet service providers
- protocols: how devices are connected. e.g.: http/streaming/skype/tcp/ip/wifi/4G/ethernet
 
 ### Standards and Organisations:
 - RFC: rerquest for comments
 - IETP: Internet Engineering Task Force

 ## From a services view:
 - an infrastructure that provides services to applications

 ## Protocol:
 - human protocol: what's the time/I have a question/introductions
- network protocol: the format, order of messages sent and recieved among network entities and action taken on message trasmission, receipt.

## edge:

- hosts: clients and servers
- servers often in data centres
- network core: interconnected routers

## how to connect end systems to edge router?

- such as residental access nets/institutional access nets/mobile(4G/5G)

1. cable based (cable television infrastructure)

- uses FDM (frequency division multiplexing)

2. digital subsciber line (DSL) (using Telephone Infrastructure)

- use existing telephone line to central office DSLAM (access multiplexer)
- data are trasmitted to high frequency tones by DSL modem and are transmitted back at DSLAM.
- 24-53 Mbps download, 3.5-16 Mbps upload

3. home network (combine broadband residential cables with wireless LAN (local area networks) technologies)

- 3 parts: Wifi access point, router/firewall/NAT, cable/DSL modem. usually integrated as 1 nowdays

4. Wireless access networks (3G/4G/5G)

- via base station aka "access point"

5. Enterprise networks
- mix of wired, wireless link technologies connecting a mix of switches and routers.
- connects to institutional mail and services.

6. Data center networks
- high-bandwidth links connecting hundreds to thousands of servers together and to internet.

## Host: send packets of data
### host sending function:
- takes application message
- breaks into smaller chunks known as packets of length L bits
- transmits packets into access network at transmission rate R
    - link transmission rate, aka link capacity aka link bandwidth.
    packet transmission delay = time needed to transmit L-bit packet into link = L/R

## physical medium/media:
- physical link: what lies between trasmitter & receiver (wires/wireless)
- guided media: signals propagate in solid media: copper/fiber/coax
- unguided media: signals propagate freely: radio...
